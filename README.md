## Prototype Application

#### This was part of my demo for class. I didn't know what I wanted to create from what we learned from the last 2 weeks of class. So this what I made for now.

#### Right now, you can load it up and log in if you have a username already in the database (Running MySql). If your not in the system, you can click on the Register button and register an account there.

#### There are some validation done within the app and also on the MySql side as well.


#### This was done using Java FXML + MySql.
